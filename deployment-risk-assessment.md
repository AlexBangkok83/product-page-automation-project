## CRITICAL RISKS (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS)

### 1. Database Domain Conflicts
**Risk**: Store creation fails because domain already exists in database
**Previous Impact**: "subdomain already exists" errors
**Probability**: Medium (if reusing test domains)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Pre-deployment validation checks database for existing domains
- ✅ Store.create() method includes conflict detection
- ✅ API returns specific error messages for domain conflicts
- 🔧 **Prevention**: Always use unique domains with timestamp suffixes

**Detection Code**:
```javascript
const existingStore = await Store.findByDomain(store.domain);
if (existingStore) {
  throw new Error(`Domain conflict: A store already exists with domain "${store.domain}"`);
}
```

### 2. File System Directory Conflicts
**Risk**: Store files generation fails because directory already exists
**Previous Impact**: "directory already exists" errors
**Probability**: Medium (after failed deployments)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Pre-deployment validation checks file system for existing directories
- ✅ Store.create() method includes filesystem conflict detection
- 🔧 **Prevention**: Clean up failed deployments automatically
- 🔧 **Recovery**: Force delete and recreate directories

**Detection Code**:
```javascript
const storePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'stores', store.domain);
if (fs.existsSync(storePath)) {
  throw new Error(`File system conflict: Directory "stores/${store.domain}" already exists`);
}
```

### 3. Undefined Variable Errors
**Risk**: Runtime errors due to undefined variables like `storeData`
**Previous Impact**: "storeData is not defined" crashes
**Probability**: Low (code audit shows proper definitions)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Code audit confirms `storeData` is properly defined in all contexts
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling in API routes
- 🔧 **Prevention**: Use ESLint for static analysis
- 🔧 **Detection**: Add runtime validation for critical variables

**Code Locations Verified**:
- `/routes/api.js:216` - `const storeData = { ... }`
- `/routes/index.js:340` - `const storeData = { ... }`
- `/models/Store.js:49` - `static async create(storeData)`

### 4. Vercel Configuration Conflicts
**Risk**: Deployment fails due to conflicting Vercel settings
**Previous Impact**: Build/deployment failures
**Probability**: Low (configuration is clean)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Vercel configuration audit confirms no conflicting `builds` property
- ✅ Serverless function properly configured
- ✅ Routes correctly defined
- 🔧 **Prevention**: Lock configuration with version control

**Current Configuration Status**:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": { "api/serverless.js": { "maxDuration": 30 } },
  "routes": [{ "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/api/serverless.js" }]
}
```

---

## HIGH RISKS (POTENTIAL FAILURES)

### 5. Agent System Infinite Loops
**Risk**: Agent automation system creates infinite loops consuming resources
**Previous Impact**: System slowdown, memory exhaustion
**Probability**: Low (circuit breakers implemented)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Circuit breakers: `maxActiveAgents = 50`
- ✅ Emergency shutdown mechanisms
- ✅ Recursion depth limits: `maxRecursionDepth = 3`
- 🔧 **Monitoring**: Track agent deployment patterns
- 🔧 **Recovery**: Automatic system reset on detected loops

**Protection Code**:
```javascript
if (this.activeAgents.size >= this.maxActiveAgents) {
  console.warn('🚨 Agent limit reached, preventing new deployments');
  return false;
}
```

### 6. Template Rendering Failures
**Risk**: Store file generation fails due to template errors
**Previous Impact**: Empty or malformed HTML files
**Probability**: Low (templates are static)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Template files are validated and static
- ✅ Fallback content generation for missing templates
- 🔧 **Recovery**: Basic page generation if templates fail
- 🔧 **Validation**: Pre-deployment template integrity checks

### 7. Database Connection Failures
**Risk**: SQLite database becomes locked or corrupted
**Previous Impact**: All operations fail
**Probability**: Low (SQLite is reliable)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Connection retry logic in database layer
- ✅ Database initialization on startup
- 🔧 **Recovery**: Automatic database recreation if corrupted
- 🔧 **Backup**: Periodic database backups

---

## MEDIUM RISKS (DEGRADED EXPERIENCE)

### 8. Network Connectivity Issues
**Risk**: External API calls (Shopify validation) fail
**Previous Impact**: Store creation succeeds but Shopify integration fails
**Probability**: Medium (external dependency)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Timeout handling for all external API calls
- ✅ Graceful degradation - store creation continues without Shopify
- 🔧 **Recovery**: Retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- 🔧 **Fallback**: Allow store creation without Shopify validation

### 9. Domain Propagation Delays
**Risk**: Store deploys successfully but domain takes time to become accessible
**Previous Impact**: "Site not found" during immediate testing
**Probability**: High (DNS propagation is normal)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Set expectation that domain propagation takes 5-15 minutes
- ✅ Provide alternative access methods during propagation
- 🔧 **Monitoring**: Check domain accessibility with retries
- 🔧 **Communication**: Clear messaging about propagation delays

### 10. File Permission Issues
**Risk**: Cannot write store files due to permission restrictions
**Previous Impact**: Deployment fails silently
**Probability**: Low (development environment)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Pre-deployment write permission checks
- 🔧 **Detection**: Test file creation before actual deployment
- 🔧 **Recovery**: Clear error messages for permission issues

---

## LOW RISKS (MINOR ISSUES)

### 11. Resource Exhaustion
**Risk**: High memory/disk usage during bulk operations
**Previous Impact**: System slowdown
**Probability**: Low (single store deployments)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- 📝 Monitor resource usage during deployments
- 📝 Implement resource limits if needed

### 12. Concurrent Access Issues
**Risk**: Multiple simultaneous deployments conflict
**Previous Impact**: Database lock errors
**Probability**: Low (single user testing)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- 📝 Add deployment locking if multiple users detected
- 📝 Queue system for concurrent requests

   - Check server logs for specific errors
   - Identify failure stage in pipeline

2. **Quick Fixes** (2 minutes)

   - Use different domain name
   - Skip optional features (Shopify integration)

3. **Fallback Options** (5 minutes)
   - Deploy to subdomain instead of custom domain
   - Use manual file generation
   - Create static demo environment
   - Use pre-built demo store

4. **Communication Strategy**
   - Acknowledge issue immediately
   - Provide estimated resolution time
   - Show alternative demo if available
   - Document lesson learned
