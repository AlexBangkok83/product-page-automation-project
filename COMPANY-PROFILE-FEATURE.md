- **Web Routes**: Added `/admin/company-profile` route in `/routes/index.js`

#### Database
- **Schema Updates**: Added new table in `/database/db.js`
- **Migrations**: Automatic table creation on server start

### Frontend Components

#### Views

## Security Considerations

### Access Token Protection
- Tokens are stored securely in the database
- API responses exclude sensitive access token data (`toSafeJSON()` method)
- Frontend never displays actual access tokens

### Connection Validation
- Real Shopify API validation before storing credentials
- Periodic health checks to ensure connections remain valid
- Clear error messaging for failed connections

### Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- Domain format validation
- Access token format checking
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

## Usage Workflow

   - Test connections periodically

### Using Saved Stores in Site Setup

1. **Start Site Setup**
   - Navigate to `/admin/site-setup`

2. **Select Shopify Store (Step 2)**
